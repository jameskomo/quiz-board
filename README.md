# **Project Name: TRIANGLE TRACKER**

## **Project description**
This quiz board project simulates a real paper work exam done in classes by students. 
The student/user is able to see several questions when the website loads.
Each question has a number of points awarded when scored right. 
The user is able to tick the correct answer through a radio button and submit answers when done taking the quiz. Once the answers are submitted, the student/user gets the results of what they scored and they are able to know their overall performance using a predefined criteria. 

As with normal exams, students are allowed to leave blank answers.
