# **Project Name: TRIANGLE TRACKER**

## **Project description**
This application will help users know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.

Based on the functionality of the application, the following will be expected:

-For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
-For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
-For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
-Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)

## **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)**

Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle. If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene).
The application enables the user to enter values of a triangle then alerts what type of triangle it is.
After the user keys in the values and presses Check!, an alert dialogue box pops up and tells the user what triangle matches the entered values. When you click the "Reset" button in the alert dialogue box you can reset your app so that you may re-enter your values again and so on.

The user enter length of side1, side2 and side3
If the sum of two sides is equal or exceeds the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle
If the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that an Equilateral triangle.
If two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle
If the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle.

The application does not allow special characters or strings in the input fields as a triangle should only have number values.
